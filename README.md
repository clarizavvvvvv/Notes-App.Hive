Notes App (Hive + BLoC) - light blue theme

How to run (Chrome):
1. Extract this folder into your project (replace lib/ and pubspec.yaml), or place inside a new flutter project folder.
2. In project root run:
   flutter pub get
   flutter create .
   flutter run -d chrome

Notes:
- Hive is initialized in main.dart using hive_flutter; works on web (IndexedDB).
- If you already have a project created by `flutter create`, just replace lib/ and pubspec.yaml then run `flutter pub get`.
